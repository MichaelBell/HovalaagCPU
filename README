An implementation of the CPU from the Hovalaag game.

A description of the CPU can be found at http://silverspaceship.com/hovalaag/docs.html

The CPU is implemented in Hovalaag.v and HovalaagALU.v

There is a very simple test harness in Hovalaag_test.v

hovalaag_top.v is the top level module for a harness for the CPU on the Digilent BASYS 2 FPGA dev board.  This links the CPU to a program contained in Program.v, and displays the outputs on the development board's seven segment display.

There are two possible ways to use the Hovalaag data inputs in hovalaag_top.v, either two separate input banks, or OUT2 looped back to IN2 via a FIFO as in the later Hovalaag puzzles.

The assembler for hovalaag can be downloaded from http://silverspaceship.com/hovalaag/assembler.zip
The assembler produces a binary output file a.out.  

In the Inject directory there's a program that will inject a.out and the contents of input.txt to the Hovalaag using the Digilent DEPP interface over USB.
