An implementation of the CPU from the Hovalaag game.
Download and play Hovalaag from: http://silverspaceship.com/hovalaag/

A description of the CPU can be found at http://silverspaceship.com/hovalaag/docs.html

The CPU is implemented in Hovalaag.v and HovalaagALU.v

There is a very simple test harness in Hovalaag_test.v

hovalaag_top.v is the top level module for a harness for the CPU on the Digilent BASYS 2 FPGA dev board.  This links the CPU to a program contained in Program.v, and displays the outputs on the development board's seven segment display.

The assembler for hovalaag can be downloaded from http://silverspaceship.com/hovalaag/assembler.zip
The assembler produces a binary output file a.out.  This can be converted to a format that can be pasted into the case statement in Program.v by bin2verilog.py.

Note that this implementation is in early stages - it has had very little testing!
